# ---------------------------
# What are Loops?
# ---------------------------
# Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.
# Python supports two main types of loops:
# 1. for loop
# 2. while loop

# ---------------------------
# for Loop
# ---------------------------
# Used to iterate over a sequence (like list, string, range, etc.)

print("Using for loop with range:")
for i in range(5):
    print("Value:", i)

print("\nUsing for loop with list:")
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# ---------------------------
# while Loop
# ---------------------------
# Executes as long as the condition is true

print("\nUsing while loop:")
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1

#   ● Work with sequence or range.             ● work with condition
#   ● loop control is built-in like-           ● You must manually update condition
#     range(start,end,step)  
#   ● when you know how many times to repeat.  ● when you don't know how many times to repeat.

#   ● When you looping overime (fixed range).  ●  loop until a condition become false.


# ---------------------------
# break Statement
# ---------------------------
# Used to exit the loop prematurely

print("\nUsing break in a loop:")
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print("Break Example:", i)

# ---------------------------
# continue Statement
# ---------------------------
# Skips the current iteration and moves to the next

print("\nUsing continue in a loop:")
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print("Continue Example:", i)

# ---------------------------
# Nested Loops
# ---------------------------
# Loops within loops

print("\nNested loop output:")
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(i, "x", j, "=", i * j)

# ---------------------------
# else with Loops
# ---------------------------
# The else block executes after the loop ends normally (no break)

print("\nUsing else with for loop:")
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
